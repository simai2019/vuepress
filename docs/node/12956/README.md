# Smile Bible Study Course 000



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This course is intended for those who are interested in knowing what Bible is about. Attendees are not required to believe during and after this course but are encouraged to find out for themselves whether Bible is believable.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; One group leader is needed to lead this Bible study and other believers in this group could be trained at the same time to lead this group too. The group leader does not have to give answers to all the Bible questions of the group members (unless he/she know the answers) but will direct those questions to the pastor so that he/she will learn from the pastor and will give the answers in the next meeting.&nbsp;In this way the leader will not under great pressure and will grow in knowledge and life with the pastor. The mature group leader need to review with those who are learning how to lead a group after the group study so that they grow together. Those who have not led a group before can click this link to listen to two lectures in Chinese about how to lead a group.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The typical group activities might include singing, ice-breaking, sharing, praying and Bible study. But they are flexible according to who attedees are and how many. A typical group meeting will last about 2 hours.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; During the first meeting we will ask each one to introduce himself and will teach them the 4 values of our group: 1) honesty . we need to honest to each other. 2)acceptance. we need to accept each other. &nbsp;2)respect. We need to respect each other 3)equality. We are equal dispite of our age, education, performance and appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
